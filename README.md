This is a simplest demo of Message Driven Beans
Message is sent to the server through a JSP form to the Servlet,
which processes it and sends it to the server.

I have used Netbeans 7.3.1 and GlassFish server 4.0
Created a JMS Connection Factory named: jms/connFactory
and
JMS Destination Resources: jms/dest

using glassfish admin console
